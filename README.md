📊 Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer
Hybrid Web + Desktop Application

📌 Project Overview

The Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer is a hybrid application developed using Django, React, and PyQt5. It allows users to upload CSV files containing chemical equipment parameters and visualize the data through interactive charts and tables on both Web and Desktop platforms.

🚀 Key Features:

✅ Upload CSV files from Web and Desktop applications
✅ Parse and analyze data using Pandas
✅ Display equipment details in tabular format
✅ Generate interactive charts (Chart.js & Matplotlib)
✅ Summary statistics (count, averages, distributions)
✅ Store last 5 uploaded datasets (SQLite)
✅ RESTful API using Django REST Framework
✅ Basic Authentication (Optional Feature)
✅ PDF Report Generation (Optional Feature)
